**The same decisions, on CPU.**

Native C++ inference for [Dohnuts](https://github.com/PsiACE/dohnuts), built on
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). It runs the released Qwen3.5-0.8B base with the
merged Dohnuts LoRA, scores candidate markers with the scalar decision head, and
returns probabilities from a single forward pass. No GPU, no generation.

The base keeps its frozen vision tower, so an optional mmproj file adds image
decisions (see [Vision](#vision)). The same binary also runs the larger
Dohnuts-family model [Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B](#linnaeus-010-2b) and other decision
models such as `decider`, `thisthat` and `kev` through profiles (see
[Other decision models](#other-decision-models)).

> [!NOTE]
> 🎉 For models that the llama.cpp server already supports, prefer
> [`llama-server`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/29818). dohnuts.cpp
> is expected to stay focused on the Dohnuts family and on early support for
> small side models.

## One message, several decisions

Serve the model:

```sh
build/dohnuts-cli --server --port 8080 \
  --model work/dohnuts-Q8_0.gguf --head work/head.f32 \
  --metadata models/dohnuts-0.1.0/dohnuts.json
```

Route a support request and check whether it asks for a refund in the same call:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/systemone -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":{"message":"I was charged twice. Please refund the duplicate."},
       "questions":{"route":{"type":"choice","instructions":"Which team should handle this?",
         "criteria":["billing","technical support","sales"]},
         "refund":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Is a refund requested?"}}}'
```

```json
{"model":"dohnuts",
 "answers":{
   "route":{"type":"choice","confidence":0.2632,
     "probabilities":{"billing":0.6223,"technical support":0.3283,"sales":0.0494},
     "choice":"billing"},
   "refund":{"type":"noul","confidence":0.9572,"noul":0.9572}},
 "usage":{"input_tokens":93,"images":0}}
```

`choice`, `score`, and `noul` behave as in
[Dohnuts](https://github.com/PsiACE/dohnuts). `/predict` takes one request or an
array; `/health` and `/v1/models` describe the server. Pass `--api-key KEY` to
require `Authorization: Bearer KEY`, and `--cors-origin ORIGIN` to restrict CORS
(open by default). Run a file of requests with `--input requests.jsonl`, or add
`--raw` to print uncalibrated scorer logits.

## Build

Requires CMake 3.14+ and a C++20 compiler. On Ubuntu / Debian the two scripts
below install the dependencies and build the CLI (extra CMake arguments are
forwarded, e.g. a GPU backend):

```sh
sudo scripts/setup.sh
scripts/build.sh
```

Manual build:

```sh
git submodule update --init --depth 1
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_NATIVE=ON
cmake --build build -j --target dohnuts-cli
```

llama.cpp is pinned to release `v0.4.1` as a submodule; `-DLLAMA_DIR=...` points
the build at another checkout.

### Windows (cross-compile)

From Ubuntu / Debian, MinGW-w64 cross-compiles a self-contained
`dohnuts-cli.exe` (no extra DLLs):

```sh
sudo scripts/setup.sh --with-mingw
scripts/build_windows.sh
```

### GPU

The default build is CPU only. CUDA, Vulkan, ROCm (HIP), and Metal are optional
backends; enable one at configure time:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOHNUTS_CUDA=ON     # NVIDIA
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOHNUTS_VULKAN=ON   # AMD or Intel
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOHNUTS_HIP=ON      # AMD ROCm
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOHNUTS_METAL=ON    # Apple
cmake --build build -j --target dohnuts-cli
```

Each backend needs its own toolchain: the CUDA Toolkit, the Vulkan SDK (`glslc`
and the loader), ROCm, or the Xcode command line tools. When cross-compiling, pin
the target GPU with `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89` (CUDA) or
`-DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100` (HIP).

Offload at runtime with `--gpu-layers -1` (all layers) or a positive layer count,
and select devices with `--device CUDA0` or a comma-separated list.
`--list-devices` prints what the build can use. A CPU-only build ignores
`--gpu-layers`, so the same command line works everywhere.

## Models

Pre-converted GGUF files are published at
[DreamBlooms/Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-GGUF):

| File | Quantization |
| --- | --- |
| `Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-f16.gguf` | F16 |
| `Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf` | Q8_0 |
| `Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-Q6_K.gguf` | Q6_K |
| `Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-Q4_K_M.gguf` | Q4_K_M |
| `mmproj-dohnuts-0.1.0-bf16.gguf` | Vision encoder (BF16, optional) |

`head.f32` (the scorer head) and `dohnuts.json` (calibration) are required
alongside any GGUF. Download one quantization plus both small files:

```sh
hf download DreamBlooms/Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-GGUF \
  Dohnuts-0.1.0-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf head.f32 dohnuts.json --local-dir models
```

### Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B

[Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-GGUF) is
a 2B member of the Dohnuts family: the same prompt and scalar-head readout, built
on Qwen3.5-2B (Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B plus a rank-8 LoRA). Its metadata names the
`dohnuts` profile, so the commands above work with the Linnaeus paths swapped in.

| File | Quantization |
| --- | --- |
| `Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-F16.gguf` | F16 |
| `Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-Q8_0.gguf` | Q8_0 |
| `Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-Q4_K_M.gguf` | Q4_K_M |
| `mmproj-Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-bf16.gguf` | Vision encoder (BF16, optional) |

As with Dohnuts, every quantization needs `head.f32` (the scorer head) and
`linnaeus.json` (calibration) alongside it:

```sh
hf download DreamBlooms/Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-GGUF \
  Linnaeus-0.1.0-2B-Q8_0.gguf head.f32 linnaeus.json --local-dir models
```

Rebuild the files from the upstream adapter with
`scripts/build_linnaeus_gguf.sh`: merge the rank-8 LoRA into Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B,
export the head, convert with `--no-mtp`, then quantize.

### Build the GGUF yourself

The release ships a compact checkpoint, not a standalone language model. Merge it
into the base once, then convert and quantize:

```sh
python3 scripts/export_dohnuts.py \
    --base models/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
    --adapter models/dohnuts-0.1.0 \
    --out work/merged --head work/head.f32

scripts/build_gguf.sh work/merged work
```

This writes `dohnuts-f16.gguf`, `dohnuts-Q8_0.gguf`, and `dohnuts-Q4_K_M.gguf`.

## Vision

The Qwen3.5 base keeps its vision tower and the Dohnuts LoRA only adapts the
language side, so image decisions work without retraining. The tower ships
separately as `mmproj-dohnuts-0.1.0-bf16.gguf`; pass it with `--mmproj`:

```sh
build/dohnuts-cli --server --port 8080 \
  --model work/dohnuts-Q8_0.gguf --head work/head.f32 \
  --metadata models/dohnuts-0.1.0/dohnuts.json \
  --mmproj work/mmproj-dohnuts-0.1.0-bf16.gguf
```

Put one image in `state.image` as a base64 PNG or JPEG data URL. It is scored
exactly like the Python `state["image"]`, and the image key is dropped from the
text state:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/systemone -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":{"image":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."},
       "questions":{"shape":{"type":"choice","criteria":["square","circle"]}}}'
```

`usage.images` is 1 for image requests, 0 otherwise. One image per request is
supported, matching Dohnuts. Without `--mmproj` any image request is rejected.

Images are expensive on CPU, so a request with several questions about one image
encodes the image once and runs the leading text and its 256 vision tokens
through the language model once, then shares that state across the questions.
Images are resized to 512x512 (256 tokens) to match the Python preprocessing.

## Accuracy

Against the f32 Hugging Face reference over six text cases and one long
shared-prefix case, every candidate choice agrees:

| Precision | Max logit deviation | Max probability deviation |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| f16 | 0.573 | 0.097 |
| Q8_0 | 0.656 | 0.094 |
| Q6_K | 0.879 | 0.116 |
| Q4_K_M | 1.878 | 0.161 |

The deviations come from weight rounding and grow with quantization. Use f16,
Q8_0, or Q6_K when probabilities matter, Q4_K_M for coarse decisions.

## Speed

Qwen3.5 is a hybrid: 18 gated-delta-net layers and 6 full-attention layers. The
delta-net is the CPU bottleneck, so prefill runs at roughly 21 tokens/s on eight
threads and a two-question request takes a few seconds. Dohnuts never generates
tokens, so only prefill matters. Numbers vary with host load; use `llama-bench`
for a stable reference.

A call that asks several questions about one state decodes the shared `State:`
prefix once and copies it across the candidate sequences. Decoded prefixes are
also kept across calls in a bounded LRU (256 MiB, keyed by the exact prefix
tokens), so a state seen before skips its prefill; the gain grows with state
length and reuse. The side models share the same cache.

## Other decision models

The CLI also runs seven decision-model families, `decider`, `thisthat`, `kev`
and `tev1`, which use a different prompt and readout from Dohnuts. They are
profiles: the Dohnuts path is untouched, and none take images.

| Profile | Models | Readout | Weights | GGUF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `decider` | [decider-0.8b](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-0.8b), [decider-2b](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-2b) | LM head restricted to the option letters at an `Answer: (` slot | full fine-tune | [0.8b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/decider-0.8b-GGUF), [2b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/decider-2b-GGUF) |
| `thisthat` | [this-that-model-1.2](https://huggingface.co/flock-io/this-that-model-1.2) | LM head restricted to the option labels at each question's `Answer: (` slot, all questions in one pass | full fine-tune | [1.2](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/this-that-model-1.2-GGUF) |
| `kev` | [kev-0.8b](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b), [kev-4b](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-4b) | bilinear pointer head over the decide and option-end markers | LoRA + pointer head | [0.8b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/kev-0.8b-GGUF), [4b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/kev-4b-GGUF) |
| `tev1` | [Tev1-0.8B-experimental](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/Tev1-0.8B-experimental) | LM head restricted to the option letters after the chat decision prompt | full fine-tune | [0.8b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/Tev1-0.8B-experimental-GGUF) |
| `jet` | [jet](https://huggingface.co/michaljach/jet) | LM head restricted to the option labels after the chat decision prompt, one temperature per question type | full fine-tune | [4b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/jet-GGUF) |
| `jpt` | [jpt-4b](https://huggingface.co/kirp/jpt-4b) | LM head restricted to the option labels after the chat decision prompt | LoRA merged | [4b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/jpt-4b-GGUF) |
| `neohorsejev` | [NeoHorse-Jev-4B](https://huggingface.co/TokenRhythm/NeoHorse-Jev-4B) | bilinear pointer head over the decide and option-end markers, one row per question over a shared state prefix | LoRA merged + pointer head | [4b](https://huggingface.co/DreamBlooms/NeoHorse-Jev-4B-GGUF) |

Pass the matching model config as `--metadata`; the file names its own profile
(`"profile": "decider"`, `"profile": "thisthat"`, `"profile": "kev"`,
`"profile": "tev1"`, `"profile": "jet"`, `"profile": "jpt"` or
`"profile": "neohorsejev"`), so no flag is needed. `--profile` overrides the
file, and `dohnuts` is the default. `kev` and `neohorsejev` additionally need
`--head`:

JPT uses the text chat prompt with thinking disabled and contextual label tokens
after `Answer:`. Its yes/no probability follows the affirmative label, which
comes first in JPT's option order. Jet reads letter logits for choices, digit
logits for scores, and `no`/`yes` logits for yes/no questions. Both use the
Qwen3.5 assistant turn from the embedded tokenizer template.

```sh
# decider: no scorer head, one temperature from decider.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/decider-0.8b-q8_0.gguf \
  --metadata work/side/decider.json

# kev: bilinear head plus one temperature from kev.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/kev-0.8b-q8_0.gguf \
  --head work/side/kev-head.f32 --metadata work/side/kev.json

# thisthat: no scorer head, one temperature from thisthat.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/thisthat-1.2-q8_0.gguf \
  --metadata work/side/thisthat.json

# tev1: no scorer head, one temperature from tev1.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/tev1-0.8b-q8_0.gguf \
  --metadata work/side/tev1.json

# jet: no scorer head, one temperature per question type from jet.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/jet-4b-q8_0.gguf \
  --metadata work/side/jet.json

# jpt: no scorer head, one temperature from jpt.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/jpt-4b-q8_0.gguf \
  --metadata work/side/jpt.json

# neohorsejev: bilinear head plus one temperature from neohorsejev.json
build/dohnuts-cli --model work/side/neohorsejev-4b-q8_0.gguf \
  --head work/side/neohorsejev-head.f32 --metadata work/side/neohorsejev.json
```

The same flags run the larger sizes; only the GGUF, head, and config paths change.

The response keeps the same core fields (`type`, `choice`, `probabilities`,
`noul`, `score`, `confidence`), so clients work unchanged. Each profile adds its
native statistics under `native`: `certainty`, and `legend` / `level_fit` /
`fit_mass` for isolated `score` levels on decider; `certainty` (with `legend` for
`score`) on thisthat and tev1; the model's own confidence for kev; `jet` and
`jpt` add `certainty` (with `legend` for `score`); `neohorsejev` reports its own
semantic confidence (`level` for `score`, the linear choice score otherwise).

Rebuild them from the upstream checkpoints with:

```sh
# decider-0.8b: a full fine-tune, converted directly
scripts/build_decider_gguf.sh <decider-0.8b-dir> work/side/decider-0.8b-q8_0.gguf

# kev-0.8b: merge the LoRA into the base, export the head, then convert
scripts/build_kev_gguf.sh <Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base-dir> <kev-0.8b-dir> work/side

# thisthat-1.2: a full fine-tune, converted directly
scripts/build_thisthat_gguf.sh <thisthat-1.2-dir> work/side/thisthat-1.2-q8_0.gguf

# tev1-0.8b: a full fine-tune, converted directly
scripts/build_tev1_gguf.sh <tev1-0.8b-dir> work/side/tev1-0.8b-q8_0.gguf

# jet: a full fine-tune, converted directly
scripts/build_jet_gguf.sh <jet-dir> work/side/jet-4b-q8_0.gguf

# jpt-4b: a merged LoRA, converted directly
scripts/build_jpt_gguf.sh <jpt-4b-dir> work/side/jpt-4b-q8_0.gguf

# neohorsejev-4b: convert the backbone, then export the pointer head
scripts/build_neohorsejev_gguf.sh <NeoHorse-Jev-4B-dir> work/side
python3 scripts/export_neohorsejev_head.py <NeoHorse-Jev-4B>/pointer_head.safetensors \
  work/side/neohorsejev-head.f32
```

Every export is quantized to Q8_0. `kev` merges the LoRA in fp32 before
conversion and writes `kev-head.f32` (the q and k pointer rows with their biases)
plus `kev.json`. The same scripts handle the larger sizes with the matching base
(Qwen3.5-2B for decider-2b, Qwen3.5-4B for kev-4b); pass `--stream` for a
low-memory merge (one tensor at a time) on checkpoints too large to hold in RAM.

## How it works

Dohnuts reads the post-norm hidden state at each candidate marker, applies one
scalar head, and temperature-scales a softmax per question. llama.cpp supports
the architecture (`qwen35`) and exposes all of it through the public API, so the
core is unchanged:

| Dohnuts | Here |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt template with a reserved marker token per candidate | `protocol.cpp`, tokenized without special tokens |
| Hidden state at each marker | `llama_get_embeddings_ith` with `embeddings=true`, pooling off |
| Scalar scorer `Linear(1024, 1)` | `head.f32` dot product in `engine.cpp` |
| Temperature softmax, entropy confidence, expected score | `calibrate_answer` in `protocol.cpp` |
| Shared input prefix | common prefix decoded once, then `llama_memory_seq_cp` |
| Frozen vision tower + merger | mtmd with `mmproj-dohnuts-0.1.0-bf16.gguf`; M-RoPE positions injected per image chunk |

The side profiles use the same backend but their own readout: decider, thisthat
and tev1 restrict the LM head to the option labels, and kev projects the decide
and option-end hidden states through a bilinear pointer head. decider, thisthat
and tev1 share the single-token label table and the letter-restricted softmax;
thisthat also folds a request's questions into one prompt, one answer slot each,
and reads them in one pass.

Norm weights are stored as `weight + 1`, matching the Dohnuts fused kernels.
